## How we work

We place a strong focus on building trust and shared understanding with the activists we work with. We listen to their needs, work out we could augment their organisational capacity and directly co-design tools in collaboration with them.

We work in agile sprints: short bursts of focused activity where we follow a build-measure-learn cycle. This enables us to iterate quickly and efficiently, ensuring that we meet real needs without wasting resources on unnecessary features.
