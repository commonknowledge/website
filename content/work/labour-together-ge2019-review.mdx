Common Knowledge interviewed a range of Labour Party staff, elected representatives and activist members as a contribution to the [Labour Together 2019 election review](https://www.labourtogether.uk/), and contributed to editorial discussions between April and June.

Our research, analysing the Labour Party's organisational structures and digital estate, is documented in a two part subsidiary report that was used to inform the main publication released on 19th June.

We also took this opportunity to produce an [**organogram of the Labour Party**](https://whimsical.com/M8tVcVzqDWX1GEZLpKxsVV#VsSo8s35UryBjXUEZpKiAM) circa Winter 2019.
