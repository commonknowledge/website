intro: Reflecting on the importance of doing deep and dense work, rather than getting caught up in short-term, urgency thinking.

One of the aspects of political organising that we often discuss internally is the importance of doing deep and dense work, rather than getting caught up in busyness.

Our focus is broad, systemic change, rather than just electoral cycles. To achieve this level of change, we need to be thinking and acting at the same kind of scale — something that requires space and time. We see cultivating deep attention and patience as an act of political resistance.

Staying politically engaged in today’s social media landscape can be exhausting. It’s easy to get swept up in feeling like you need to continuously produce and respond to content, across a range of social contexts, at a pace that is impossible to maintain.

This unsustainable level of engagement is, at best, a constant source of distraction and anxiety and, at worst, leads to burnout. Burnout is a threat on both an individual level and a collective one, as activist groups often rely too heavily on the knowledge and work of one person. If this person burns out, it can significantly impact the rest of the group and its work.

How can we avoid burnout, while still staying engaged and achieving our political outcomes?

We think that it starts with recognising that:

## 1. You will never be able to keep up

It is simply impossible to keep up with the level of engagement that social media requires of us. Sometimes the most effective thing you can do is to not engage.

One method that we’re trying internally is being more thoughtful and thematic in our social media use, rather than being constantly reactive.

## 2. You need to replenish your energy somewhere

This means taking breaks, often, even if it feels self-indulgent or that you’re letting others down. It’s never going to feel like the right time to do this.

It also means sleeping properly. You are no use to any group if you’re operating below capacity due to overwork or anxiety.

These practices aren’t just about productivity, but also about collective care. Each meeting we have begins and ends with a check-in, one of the key patterns of sociocracy. Check-ins are a way of sharing our emotional states, recognising that this changes day-by-day and is influenced by external factors as well as work.

We’re going to be exploring this topic more over the next few days, looking into the different tools and structures that activists can use to maintain their individual and collective health.
